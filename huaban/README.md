## Huaban Spider

This program is plan to crawl a specific user's boards (I think this can also call it as category directory).

- `get_boards_url.py` is used to save the urls of id (category directory)  of a user in huaban.com to the local `urls.txt` file.

- `huaban_spider.py` is get from https://github.com/luoyi2017/huaban_spider . I just made very minor changes to the code.

## How to Run

Firstly, run the `get_boards_url.py` to get urls and save it to `urls.txt`.

Second, run the `huaban_spider.py`, Slower speed is normal, when there are more URLs.
